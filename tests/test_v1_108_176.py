"""A partial index stops reporting itself fresh (#375 sub-problem C).

The reported symptom: "it has learned about 7,659 of 9,634 code files. But it
still reports itself as up to date. So 'I never learned that file' and 'that
file doesn't exist' look identical to every agent." That ambiguity is why a
paying user moved their default code lookup to another tool.

The cause is a category error, not a broken check. Freshness answered "is the
index BEHIND the tree in time" (index SHA vs git HEAD) and was being read as
"does the index COVER the tree". A corpus that dropped files at index time sits
at the SAME SHA as the checkout, so it truthfully reported `fresh` while whole
files were missing.

Underneath it, `index_folder`'s second pass dropped files with three
uncounted `continue`s, so the corpus could end up smaller than the walk
reported with nothing anywhere recording the difference.
