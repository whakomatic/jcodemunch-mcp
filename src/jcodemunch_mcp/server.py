# --- MCP `instructions` (initialize response) ------------------------------ #
# The one piece of jcodemunch prose that survives TOOL DEFERRAL. When a host has
# more tools than its schema budget allows it sends tool NAMES only and withholds
# the JSONSchemas until a ToolSearch-style lookup fetches them. We ship 91 tools
# on the default surface, so in a deferred session every description we budget
# and smell-test (`test_description_smells.py`, the 4,000-token core_compact
# ceiling) is invisible at exactly the moment steering matters most.
#
# The MCP spec delivers `instructions` on a separate track from the tool list, so
# it arrives whole even then. Two jobs, in this order:
#   1. Defuse the deferral tax. ONE lookup loads the whole working set for the
#      session, so the cost is a single round trip and not two calls per use.
#   2. Say what each tool is FOR as a decision rule, not a feature summary. In a
#      plain MCP client with no hooks and no skill listing, this string plus the
#      tool descriptions are the entire steering budget we get.
#
# ⚠ Budget: under _MCP_INSTRUCTIONS_MAX_CHARS. Nothing proves a longer one
# survives un-truncated, and observed sibling servers sit at 660-984.
# ⚠ Every tool named here must be a real dispatchable name on the surface it is

# this cannot rot into advertising a tool we do not serve.

# jcodemunch-mcp — Workflow Guide

Use these tools instead of Grep/Read/search for any indexed repository.

## Step-by-step

1. **list_repos** — check if the project is already indexed.
   - If not found, run **index_folder** (local) or **index_repo** (GitHub URL).

2. **search_symbols** — find functions, classes, methods by name or description.
   - Use `detail_level: "full"` to get source inline, or follow up with **get_symbol_source**.

3. **get_context_bundle** — get symbol source + its imports in one call.

4. **search_text** — fall back to full-text / regex search for string literals or comments.

5. **get_file_outline** — list all symbols in a file without reading the whole thing.

## Claude Code deferred-tool note

jcodemunch tools may appear as *deferred* in your system-reminder. Call **ToolSearch** with
a query like `"list repos"` or `"search symbols"` to load the full schema before use.
Set `discovery_hint: false` in config.jsonc to suppress the reminder in tool descriptions.

Goal: Onboard to a repo you've never seen before.

1. **list_repos** → check if indexed. If not, run **index_folder** (local) or **index_repo** (GitHub).
2. **get_repo_outline** → directory structure, languages, most-imported files, most-central symbols (PageRank).
3. **get_repo_health** → dead code %, avg complexity, hotspots, dependency cycles, unstable modules.
4. **get_file_outline** on the 2–3 most-central files → understand the core.
5. **get_class_hierarchy** → inheritance structure (if OOP codebase).
6. **get_dependency_graph** on the entry point file (`direction="importers"`, `depth=2`) → what depends on the core.

**Deep path** (manual drill-down):
1. **get_changed_symbols** → map the git diff to added/removed/modified/renamed symbols.
2. **get_blast_radius** on each changed file → depth-scored transitive impact + `has_test_reach` per file.
3. **get_impact_preview** on key changed symbols → "what breaks?" analysis.
4. **get_symbol_provenance** on unfamiliar symbols → understand why the code exists before changing it.
5. **check_rename_safe** if any symbols were renamed → verify no broken refs.
6. **get_untested_symbols** on affected files → flag unreached symbols in the blast radius.
7. **get_coupling_metrics** on changed files → check if the change increases coupling.
8. **get_dependency_cycles** → check if the change introduces new cycles.

3. **get_untested_symbols** → functions with no test-file reachability.
4. **get_dependency_cycles** → full cycle list with file paths.
5. **get_hotspots** with `top_n=10`, `days=90` → highest-risk symbols by complexity × churn.
6. **get_layer_violations** → architectural boundary violations.
7. **get_extraction_candidates** → functions that should be refactored out.

    # ⚠⚠ `disabled_tools` ships as `["test_summarizer"]`, so at SHIPPED DEFAULTS
    # this guide advertised a tool `call_tool` then refuses — an agent reads the
    # name here, calls it, and gets an error before the handler runs. Nothing
    # about that is configuration-dependent; it was the out-of-the-box state.
    #
    # ⚠⚠ The filtering already existed and a SECOND generator walked around it.
    # Commit e086e9a ("claude-md respects tool_profile and disabled_tools", #242)
    # added exactly this to `cli/init.py`, which is why the CLI policy path
    # filters correctly today. This function is the other generator and never
    # received it. **Reuse `_get_active_tools` rather than writing a third
    # filter** — a copy is how these two drifted apart in the first place.
    #
    # ⚠ Profile is honoured too, not just `disabled_tools`. The registered
    # description promises the guide "Matches the active tool surface, tier and
    # disabled_tools", and `tier` is the profile. A profile-hidden tool stays
    # dispatchable by name, so naming it costs context rather than erroring

    """Make CLI output UTF-8 regardless of the platform locale (v1.108.262).

    ⚠⚠ On Windows, `sys.stdout` is the **console** stream (already UTF-8) when
    attached to a terminal and the **locale** stream (cp1252) when piped or
    redirected. So a command that prints any character cp1252 cannot encode
    works interactively and dies the moment anyone consumes it:

        jcodemunch-mcp receipt --explain            # fine
        jcodemunch-mcp receipt --explain | more     # UnicodeEncodeError, no output

    Measured: `receipt --explain` writes U+2212 MINUS SIGN and `render_diagram`
    writes U+2713 CHECK MARK. That is a hard traceback out of a shipped command,
    in the one configuration nobody exercises by hand and every script uses.
    Sibling of the cp1252 DECODE class swept in v1.108.230; that sweep covered
    subprocess input and left output alone.

    Fixed at the entry point rather than per string, because the next non-ASCII
    character someone adds must not reintroduce this.

    ⚠ The MCP stdio transport is unaffected: it wraps `sys.stdout.buffer` in its
    own TextIOWrapper, so it never reads the text layer being reconfigured here.
    Verified before this shipped.

    ⚠ `errors="replace"` is deliberate. Filesystem paths can carry surrogates
    from a `surrogateescape` decode, and those raise even under UTF-8. Mangling
    one character in a display string beats killing the command.

    ⚠ `PYTHONIOENCODING` is honoured as an explicit opt-out: if the operator
