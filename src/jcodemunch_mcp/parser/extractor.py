# Languages whose constants can only be written INSIDE a type, so the constant
# walk must accept a container parent as well as no parent (#428). Membership is
# a statement about the LANGUAGE, not a preference: Java has no file-scope
# constant to find. Adding a language here without a sample in
# tests/test_constant_extraction_guard.py is the failure that issue is about.
# ⚠⚠ kotlin joined in #732, and NOT as part of the property fix -- it closes a
# hole that fix would otherwise have made structural. `const val` inside a
# `companion object` is THE idiomatic Kotlin constant, and at class or object
# scope the constant channel never ran, so it was dropped. Once
# `property_declaration` was declared, `_extract_name` began DECLINING those
# same nodes to a channel that could not accept them: disjoint, but no longer
# exhaustive. Measured before the fix: `MAX_SIZE`, `INNER_CONST` and
# `BAR_CONST` were emitted by neither channel. Found in review.
# ⚠⚠ gdscript joined in #777, and it is the cheapest entry this set has taken:
# `const_statement` was ALREADY in `GDSCRIPT_SPEC.constant_patterns` and a
# file-scope `const LIMIT = 3` already indexed, so the channel existed and the
# class body was the one scope it could not reach. The gap read as "GDScript
# constants are missing" and was really "the gate stops at file scope" -- which
# is why the fix is a name in this set rather than a second extractor.
_CLASS_SCOPED_CONSTANT_LANGUAGES = frozenset({"java", "kotlin", "php", "gdscript"})

#: Languages whose constants may be declared inside a FUNCTION body and are
#: still worth indexing. Separate from the class-scoped set above because it
#: widens a different half of the gate, and the reason does not transfer.
#:
#: ⚠⚠ Rust is here because we ALREADY index nested `fn`s. `fn outer() { fn
#: inner() {} const LIMIT: usize = 7; }` yielded `inner` and not `LIMIT`, and
#: neither is importable -- so the old behaviour was not "locals are excluded",
#: it was "locals are excluded unless they are functions". A rule that splits a
#: scope by node type is not a scope rule.
#:
#: ⚠ Deliberately NOT widened to Python or JS. A Python function's `X = 1` is a
#: runtime local rebindable on every call; a Rust `const` is a compile-time
#: binding the grammar marks as such. Same gate, different meaning, so the set
#: is named per language with a sample in tests/test_constant_extraction_guard.py.

class ByteSlicedSource:
    """A text view indexed by BYTE offsets, not character offsets.

    tree-sitter reports ``node.start_byte`` / ``node.end_byte`` as offsets into
    the UTF-8 encoding of the source. Slicing a decoded ``str`` with them is
    correct only while the file is pure ASCII: every earlier non-ASCII
    character shifts the window forward by (bytes - characters), so the
    extracted text becomes an unrelated run of source further down the file.
    The window keeps its byte width, so an ASCII identifier still comes back
    with the right LENGTH -- which is why the corruption reads as a plausible
    fragment rather than obvious garbage (#414, @MotoMato85).

    Assigning this in place of the decoded string keeps the offsets and the
    text in one coordinate system, leaving the slice expressions themselves
    untouched.

    ⚠ Not for the regex-based extractors. ``_parse_cobol_symbols`` and friends
    slice ``source`` with CHARACTER offsets from ``re`` matches and call
    ``.count()`` / ``.splitlines()`` on it; they are already correct and this
    view would break them.

    `when`, lambdas, expression-bodied functions): every local's direct parent
    is `statements`, and every member's is one of the three above. No walk is
    needed and the exceptions are zero.

    ⚠ The direction matters. An allowlist fails CLOSED -- a container spelling
    this set does not know yields no symbol, which is the pre-#732 status quo
    -- where a denylist fails OPEN and publishes a local as class state. A
    missed member is a gap; a false member moves a published grade.

    ⚠⚠ Kotlin published `val topLevel = 1` and `var topVar = 2` as `property`,
    the word `KIND_ORDER` reserves for class state, with `parent=None`. The
    ruling is the one Swift and Scala already carry at module scope, with JS
    `const`/`let` and Go `const`/`var` beside them: `var` is a `variable`; a
    `val` with no accessor and no delegate is a `constant` (its value is its
    initializer, or for a declaration-only `expect val` whatever the `actual`
    supplies); a `val` whose READ runs code -- a getter, which every extension
    property has, or a delegate -- is a `variable`, because its value can
    differ between reads (Swift's top-level computed `var` reads the same).

    ⚠ The CONSTANT channel still decides first and this never overrides it:
    `const val` and a SCREAMING_CASE `val` (#428, #732) are `constant` at file
    scope even with a getter or delegate (`val LOG by lazy { ... }`), because
    `kotlin_property_is_constant` reads the name as the author's declaration.
    In a class body that name rule is the whole answer, since Kotlin uses
    `val` for ordinary properties.

    ⚠⚠ **Scope is the node's DIRECT parent, never `parent_is_container`.** An
    object literal's members (`fun f() = object : R { val a = 1 }`) have a
    function or a property as their parent SYMBOL and are still members; a
    rule keyed on the missing container would call them constants.

    ⚠⚠ At file scope tree-sitter-kotlin SPILLS an accessor or delegate written
    on its own line into a SIBLING: a `getter` node; an `assignment` or
    `call_expression` starting `get(` when the getter's body holds an object
    literal (`val g: Any\\n  get() = object { ... }`, which it error-recovers);

    one; and an expression starting `by` (`val vm: VM\\n    by viewModels()`).
    Its annotations may also spill as `annotation` siblings ahead of it. So
    the sibling is read by its FIRST TOKEN as well as by its type, skipping
    comments and annotations (`_KOTLIN_SPILL_SKIP`) at every level.

    ⚠⚠ The two token halves are gated DIFFERENTLY, because Kotlin's grammar
    is: a getter binds after an initializer AND after an optional `;`
    (`(NL* ';')? NL* getter`), so `get(` counts in both cases; a delegate
    cannot follow an initializer or a `;`, so `by` counts only for a `val`
    with no initializer and no `;` in the gap (the grammar keeps `;` as no
    node, so it is read from the gap bytes, comments and annotations
    excluded).

    ⚠ A getter with NO BODY (`val a = 1 get`, `@JvmName("x") get`) is the
    default accessor: no code runs on read, so it does not count, and on the
    token path a `get` whose next TOKEN is not `(` is an ordinary expression.
    Newlines and comments between `get` and `(` are whitespace to Kotlin
    (`'get' {NL} '('`), so the next token is read from the tree.

    ⚠ Not handled, recorded: Kotlin 2.x's experimental explicit backing field
    (`val x: Int\\n  field = 1\\n  get() = field + 1`, opt-in via
    `-Xexplicit-backing-fields`) spills `field` first, so its getter is not
    reached and the `val` reads `constant`.

    `_walk_tree` runs the constant check independently of symbol extraction on
    the same node rather than as an `elif`. Two channels deciding separately
    emit `const val MAX` twice -- once as a constant, once as a property. This

    ⚠⚠ Disjoint is not exhaustive, and the difference cost a real hole.

    unless the language is in `_CLASS_SCOPED_CONSTANT_LANGUAGES`), and a

    in a companion object were emitted by NEITHER channel. Found in review.

    The rule is #428's, unchanged and moved rather than rewritten: a `const
    val` is a constant by declaration, and a plain `val` is merely immutable --
    Kotlin uses `val` for ordinary properties -- so it also counts as a

    """Give a Go method its receiver and a Go struct its fields (#778).

    ⚠⚠ **A SECOND PASS, and that is forced by the language.** Go does not
    require a type to be declared before a method on it, so a walk that
    resolved a receiver as it met one would answer `unknown` for every method
    that came first -- and would look correct on any fixture written in the
    other order. This runs against the types the walk already found.

    ⚠⚠ **Ids MOVE for every Go method**: `make_symbol_id` is keyed on the
    qualified name, and `RunIt` becomes `Audit.RunIt`. Go is the only language
    in this family that pays that, because the other five were already
    qualified and only lacked `parent`.

    ⚠⚠ **Scope is what makes a Go type name an identity, and only a
    package-level type can carry a method.** A `type` inside a function body
    is a DIFFERENT type that happens to share a name, so an owner table keyed
    on the bare name let a function-local `type Config` take the package-level
    `Config`'s method AND its fields: the method got a wrong owner, a wrong
    qualified name and a wrong id, the local type gained a field it does not
    declare, and the real type was left reporting zero members -- the very
    symptom #778 exists to fix. **That is fabrication where the pre-#778
    answer was an honest absence.** Both loops below read `root_node.children`
    and never enter a body.

    ⚠⚠ **A LINE IS NOT AN IDENTITY EITHER.** Keying methods on `start_point`
    collapsed two declarations beginning on one line -- `func (a A) X() {};
    func (a A) Y() {}` resolved `Y` and left `X` bare, because the second write
    to the dict won. gofmt splits that line, which is why such a bug survives
    review and surfaces in the one file nobody formatted. Both joins are on the
    declaration node's START BYTE, which is what the spec walk records as a
    symbol's `byte_offset`; if that ever stops holding, the lookup misses and
    the member keeps today's answer, which is the safe direction.

    ⚠ A receiver whose type is not in THIS file keeps today's answer. Go allows
    the type to live in another file of the package, this parser sees one file,
    and inventing an owner id would be worse than leaving the method
    unqualified -- absence over fabrication.

    ⚠ A struct nested anonymously inside a field (`Inner struct { Deep int }`)
    contributes `Inner` and not `Deep`: only the outer `field_declaration_list`
    is read. That under-reports in the same direction the pre-#778 tree did and
    is pinned as a limit, not a claim.

#: them properties (#743's split, which is why this returns three words).

    """Follow a member whose owner's id just moved out from under it (#821).

    Every member channel stamps `parent` with the owner's id DURING the walk,
    and the ordinal is appended here, afterwards. Both twins were stamped with
    the same string, so after renumbering that string belongs to neither.

    ⚠⚠ **The symptom is a member PROMOTED TO TOP LEVEL, not a member lost.**
    `build_symbol_tree` (`parser/hierarchy.py`) appends a child whose `parent`
    does not resolve to `roots`, so `get_file_outline` rendered a field or a
    method beside the classes as though it were module scope. ⚠ The consumer
    is `get_file_outline`; `get_class_hierarchy` never reads `parent` at all,
    and an earlier draft of this comment sent a reader to it.

    ⚠⚠ **The twin is chosen by CONTAINMENT, because that is the relationship
    that made the member a member.** The stale string cannot say which twin it
    meant -- both had it -- and neither a name nor a line is an identity. The
    member's bytes sit inside exactly one twin's bytes, and the innermost
    containing twin wins so that nesting cannot pick an outer one.

    ⚠⚠ **A member no twin CONTAINS has an UNKNOWN owner and is given NONE.**
    Rust attaches a method to an `impl` block and Go to a receiver, so neither
    sits inside the type it belongs to, and no syntax in the file says which
    twin is meant: `#[cfg(unix)] impl Conf` and `#[cfg(windows)] impl Conf`
    are distinguished by a predicate this parser does not evaluate. **A first
    or nearest twin would be a guess that reads as a fact** -- the first draft
    of this fix took `twins[0]` and filed `#[cfg(windows)]`'s method under the
    `#[cfg(unix)]` struct, in valid compiling Rust, which is the corpus #821
    was filed from. That is worse than the defect it replaced, because a
    dangling pointer is visibly broken and a wrong owner is not. Absence over
    fabrication, the family rule.

    ⚠ **Only the POINTER says unknown.** `qualified_name` AND the `id` both
    still read `Conf.only_win`, so an id-keyed consumer sees a named owner
    while a parent-keyed one sees none. That is not an oversight: an id is a
    NAME, not a pointer, and `make_symbol_id` is keyed on the qualified name,
    so moving it would re-id the symbol to say something the parser cannot
    establish either. Said here because the next reader will find the id and
    think the pointer was dropped by mistake.

    ⚠ Only ids that were actually renumbered are touched. A file with no
    duplicates never reaches this function, and inside one that does, a member
    whose owner was unique keeps its pointer untouched.

# Verse (UEFN) — regex-based symbol extraction for Epic's Verse language
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# No tree-sitter grammar exists for Verse, so this parser uses regex with a
# multi-pass strategy similar to the Blade parser above.
#
# PRIMARY USE CASE: Token-efficient lookup of UEFN API digest files.
#
# Epic ships Fortnite/UEFN API definitions as `.verse` digest files that are
# very large (the three standard digest files total ~800KB / ~200k tokens):
#
#   Fortnite.digest.verse    587KB  12,258 lines  3,608 symbols  ~147k tokens
#   Verse.digest.verse       125KB   2,368 lines    622 symbols   ~31k tokens
#   UnrealEngine.digest.verse 91KB   1,495 lines    326 symbols   ~23k tokens
#
# Loading even one of these into an LLM context window is expensive.
# With jcodemunch indexing, a typical symbol lookup returns ~94 tokens
# instead of ~147,000 — a 99.9% reduction. A search returning 10 signature
# matches costs ~130 tokens vs the full file's ~147k.
#
# ARCHITECTURE:
#
# Verse uses indentation-based scoping with a distinctive declaration syntax:
#
#   name<specifiers> := kind<specifiers>(parents):
#       member<specifiers>(...)<effects>:return_type
#       var Name<specifiers>:type
#
# Extension methods use receiver syntax:
#   (Param:type).MethodName<specifiers>()<effects>:return_type
#
# Digest files use path-prefixed declarations for namespace qualification:
#   (/Fortnite.com:)UI<public> := module:
#
# Decorators use @attribute syntax:
#   @editable
#   @available {MinUploadedAtFNVersion := 3800}
#
# The parser runs in 5 passes to handle declaration priority correctly:
#   Pass 1: Container definitions (module, class, interface, struct, enum, trait)
#   Pass 2: Extension methods — (Receiver:type).Method() syntax
#   Pass 3: Regular methods — indented Name(params) inside containers
#   Pass 4: Variables — var Name:type declarations
#   Pass 5: Constants — Name:type = value assignments
#
# IMPORTANT — Character vs byte offset handling:
#
# Python regex operates on decoded strings where multi-byte UTF-8 characters
# (e.g., smart quotes U+2019 = 3 bytes) count as 1 character. But the
# retrieval path (get_symbol_content) does binary f.seek(byte_offset), so
# stored byte_offset values MUST be real byte positions — not character
# positions. The char_pos_to_byte_pos() helper handles this conversion.
# The Verse digest files contain multi-byte UTF-8 characters in docstrings
# (smart quotes), which affects ~60% of all extracted symbols.

    Designed for Epic's Verse API digest files (Fortnite.digest.verse,

    """Every top-level class of one Vue/Svelte `<script>` block, WITH its
    members, as the generic JS/TS walk publishes them (#861).

    ⚠⚠ The Vue and Svelte channels walk their script by hand and stopped at a
    class: a declaration published its name and no member, and a class
    expression (`const C = class {...}`) published a `constant` (#803's shape in
    a channel #803 never reached). A third hand-written class walk is how the
    next member form (#802's parameter properties) would go missing here again,
    so the class and everything under it come from `parse_file`, the walk a
    `.ts` file gets.

    ⚠⚠ **`emit()` publishes EVERY group the generic walk makes, once per block;
    the hand walks only SKIP what `covers()` names.** The first draft asked the
    hand walk to fetch a class by the node it held, so every spelling the hand
    walk did not recognise (`abstract class`, `export default class {}`,
    `module.exports = class {}`, `X.P = class {}`) stayed dropped. Which
    spellings are classes is the generic walk's answer, not a second copy here.

    ⚠ `parse_file` re-checks `is_language_enabled` for the SCRIPT language: with
    `vue`/`svelte` enabled and `javascript`/`typescript` disabled it returns
    nothing, `covers()` is False everywhere and the hand walk's bare-class
    fallback publishes the class name without members, as before #861.

    Rewrapped into the component file: ids keep the generic qualified names
    (`Svc#class` is the id the old branch minted), byte offsets are shifted by
    the block's start, lines by its row, and a class's parent is the component.

    ⚠ The second parse runs only when the tree the hand walk already holds has
    a class NODE. A byte test (`b"class" in script`) fired on every `classList`
    and `className`, and cost a script with no class about a quarter more
    parse time (review, 2026-09-26).

    engine constructs while preserving byte offsets and line numbers, then

    The generic walk cannot express three things this grammar does:

    - One function is N sibling nodes: an optional ``signature`` and one
      ``function`` (or, with no arguments, ``bind``) per pattern-matched
      clause. They are merged into one symbol spanning all of them.
    - A class method is often a ``signature`` and nothing else, so inside
      ``class_declarations`` a signature alone is a method.
    - The ``->`` of a type is also a node called ``function``. It has no
      ``name`` field, which is what keeps it out.

    ⚠ Which node types are read, their kinds and their name fields all come
    from ``HASKELL_SPEC``. A node type hardcoded here would make the spec a
    second copy that nothing consults, and ``test_declared_forms_extract.py``
    fails on exactly that: it removes each spec entry and requires the symbol
    to disappear.

    ``where``/``let`` bindings are locals and are never visited: only the
    module's ``declarations`` and a class or instance body are read.
    ⚠ Not indexed, because the grammar gives them no ``name`` field or the spec
    does not declare them: an operator defined INFIX (``x |> f = ...``; the
    prefix form ``(|>) x f = ...`` has a name and is indexed), a pattern
    binding (``(p, q) = ...``), type and data families, an associated type in
    a class, ``foreign import`` and Template Haskell splices. In
    ``a, b :: Int`` the signature joins ``a`` only.

        ⚠⚠ **ONE resolver, asked by BOTH the long and the short form, and the
        first version of #738 put the `where` unwrap in the short form only.**
        That made `f(x::T) where T = x` extract while
        `function f(x::T) where T ... end` still yielded nothing -- precisely the
        short-vs-long inconsistency #738's own note invokes to decline
        `Base.length(x) = 1`, created in the commit that invoked it. Found in
        review. The grammar puts `where_expression` in the same position for
        both (`signature > where_expression > call_expression` and
        `assignment > where_expression > call_expression`), so the fix belongs
        one layer down -- which also repaired the long form for free, a gap that
        predates #738 entirely.

        ⚠ The loop is a LOOP because `where` nests: `f(x::T) where T where S`
        is `where_expression > where_expression > call_expression`, and a
        one-level unwrap silently indexes nothing. Bounded, because an unbounded
        walk over a wrapper set is a hang waiting for a pathological input.

        ⚠ `typed_expression` is here for `f(x)::Int = x`, a declared return
        type. It does NOT admit `x::Int = 5`: that unwraps to an `identifier`,
        which is not a `call_expression`, so it stays a typed variable.

        ⚠ `operator` is accepted beside `identifier` because `+(a::P, b::P) = 1`
        defines an operator method and the grammar puts the operator token where
        the identifier would be. A QUALIFIED operator (`Base.:+`) still declines,
        like every other qualified form, because its callee is a
        `field_expression` -- consistent with the long form, which cannot name
        those either.

        read `type_head > identifier`, which is only the bare spelling, so seven
        of nine type shapes yielded nothing -- and the two that worked
        (`struct P`, `abstract type A end`) are the least common in real Julia,
        where a parametric or subtyped head is the ordinary case. `_callable_name`
        one screen up is the same answer to the same question for callable heads
        (#738); a fifth bespoke helper is how the first four happened.

        ⚠⚠ **The name is the LEFT operand, never "the first identifier
        found".** `struct S <: Super` mentions two identifiers and declares one,
        and `struct Box{T}` binds `T` for the head -- so a walk that collected
        identifiers would index a supertype living in another file, and a type
        parameter, as declarations here. **That failure is worse than the
        absence it replaces**, because a fabricated symbol looks correct in a
        result list while an absent one is merely missing.

        ⚠ A `binary_expression` is unwrapped by POSITION rather than by
        matching the `<:` token. The left operand of a type head is its name
        under any operator the grammar admits there, and keying on the spelling
        is what [[a-guard-written-against-a-spelling]] names -- the same reason
        `_callable_name` unwraps `where_expression` by node type and not by
        reading the word.

        ⚠ The loop is a LOOP because the wrappers NEST: `Q{T} <: Sup{T}` is
        `binary_expression > parametrized_type_expression > identifier`, so a
        one-level unwrap handles the two simple shapes and silently drops the
        combined one. Bounded, for the reason `_callable_name` is bounded.

        ⚠ The direct-identifier fallback is kept: `abstract_definition` reached
        it before this change and nothing establishes that every spelling of

    No tree-sitter grammar covers the breadth of assembler dialects used in
    retro and embedded development, so this extractor uses regex patterns to
    support multiple assembler syntaxes in a single pass:

    - **WLA-DX** (65816/Z80/6502/SPC700): ``.section``, ``.macro``/``.endm``,
      ``.define``/``.def``, ``.struct``/``.endst``, ``.enum``/``.ende``,
      ``.ramsection``, ``.proc``/``.endproc``
    - **NASM/YASM**: ``section``, ``%define``, ``%macro``/``%endmacro``,
      ``equ``, ``struc``/``endstruc``
    - **GAS (GNU Assembler)**: ``.text``/``.data``/``.bss``, ``.set``/``.equ``,
      ``.macro``/``.endm``, ``.type``
    - **CA65 (cc65)**: ``.segment``, ``.proc``/``.endproc``,
      ``.macro``/``.endmacro``, ``.define``

    Symbol mapping:
      - Labels (``name:``) -> **function** (local ``_``-prefixed labels excluded)
      - Sections (``.section``, ``section``, ``.segment``) -> **class**
      - Macros (``.macro``, ``%macro``) -> **function**
      - Constants (``.define``, ``.def``, ``.set``, ``.equ``, ``%define``, ``equ``) -> **constant**
      - Structs (``.struct``, ``struc``) -> **type**
      - Procedures (``.proc``) -> **function**
      - Named enum members inside ``.enum``/``.ende`` -> **constant**

    Preceding ``;``-style comments are captured as docstrings.

        FOLLOWS the keyword, and `<name>` stays bound either way.
      * ``#:name`` / ``#:extra-name`` likewise bind their argument, as a struct
        TYPE name rather than a callable -- verified against `expand`, which
        keeps `struct:<name>` bound alongside it in both cases.

# The `#lang` gate
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# ⚠⚠ tree-sitter-racket parses S-EXPRESSIONS. A `#lang` line names a READER,
# and a reader can make the file's surface syntax anything at all: `#lang
# punct` is Markdown, `#lang scribble/manual` is prose, `#lang conscript` is
# at-exp text over Racket. All of them carry a `.rkt` extension, and none of
# them were looked at before this gate existed -- the walker parsed every
# `.rkt` as if it were `racket/base`.
#
# Measured on 207 `#lang conscript` files: tree-sitter reported `has_error` on
# 159, found 39% of the reader-level definitions, and FABRICATED ~100 -- an
# internal `define` promoted to module level when error recovery flattened
# the tree. The cause is four characters that are prose inside an at-exp text
# body and tokens to the grammar: `;` opens a comment, `"` opens a string that
# never closes (and takes every later definition in the file with it), `#`
# and `|` are reader prefixes. On 94 `#lang punct` files the walker emitted
# one symbol, which was correct -- Markdown has no `(define` heads -- but a
# Markdown document ABOUT Racket carries `(define ...)` in its code samples,
# and those are not bindings.
#
# So the tier is decided from the `#lang` line BEFORE the grammar runs:
#
#   sexp    the surface syntax is S-expressions -- walk as-is.
#   at-exp  blank every `{...}` text body to spaces (offsets preserved) and
#           walk the paren skeleton, where every definition lives.
#   text    a document language. Emit nothing; the file stays text-searchable.
#
# ⚠ An UNLISTED lang is `text`, by the asymmetry this whole parser is built
# on: a missed definition makes an agent read the file, a fabricated one makes
# it act on a name that does not exist. `racket_langs` in config promotes a
# project's own lang -- `{"conscript": "at-exp"}` -- because the project is the
# only party that knows what its reader produces.

#: `#lang` may follow "comment forms": `;` lines, `#| |#` blocks (one level --
#: a regex cannot nest, and a nested block above a `#lang` line has not been
