    """The spelling two identifiers are compared in (LEDGER L-84).

    ⚠⚠ Python normalises identifiers to NFKC, so `def file()` called as
    `\ufb01le()` (the fi ligature) is one function called once, and a byte
    comparison never saw the call: `check_delete_safe` read that as no
    reference and graded the used function `safe_to_delete` at 1.0.

    NFKC on both sides of a LINE or IMPORT match, for every language: a
    found reference only ever blocks a delete, and the search already
    over-matches on purpose (substring, case-insensitive). Folding can drop
    a raw hit only where a combining mark follows the identifier and NFKC
    composes it onto the last letter (`file` + U+0301), which spells a
    different identifier, so no real reference is lost.

    ⚠⚠ NEVER fold the definition-span EXCLUSION (review, L-84): that step
    REMOVES matches, and in a language that does not normalise, Java's
    `\ufb01le()` and `file()` are two methods. Folding it skipped the body of
    `\ufb01le` as `file`'s own definition and lost the call inside it --
    `safe_to_delete` at 1.0 where main blocked. The identifier is the
    declared spelling, so the exclusion needs no folding to find it.

    (LEDGER L-86) Unicode escapes are decoded first. Java translates them
    before it lexes (JLS 3.3), C# accepts them inside an identifier, and
    ECMAScript accepts its braced form there too, so a call spelled with an
    escape names the function it spells, and the raw line never matched it: a
    used Java method graded `safe_to_delete` at 1.0, and a JS function the
    same way through the braced form (review). Decoding runs on every line of
    every language, strings and comments included.
    ⚠ It cannot drop a CALL: wherever an escape can stand before a call, it
    IS one. It can drop a textual MENTION whose letters sit inside an
    escape's hex digits (a Windows path segment after a backslash that starts
    with `u` and four hex digits), which this search counted before; that is
    a mention, not a use. ⚠ Java's even-backslash rule is not applied: an
    escaped backslash followed by `u` decodes too, which only adds a match.

    ASCII is returned as `lower()` without normalising: NFKC is the
    identity there, and this runs on every line of every file.

    # ⚠⚠ The intent — "finding the name in the defining file is not a
    # reference" — was right; the implementation discarded the file rather than
    # the definition, so every SAME-FILE call site was lost and this tool
    # answered `is_referenced: false` for symbols that are demonstrably called.
    # Single-file modules were hit hardest: a helper defined and used in one
    # module read as dead code, which is the exact question this tool exists to
    # answer.

    # A list of spans per file, not one span: 102 duplicate `(file, name)` pairs
    # were measured on a real 1837-symbol index (overloads, nested defs), so one
    # span per file would leave the others counting their own signatures.
    #
    # A self-recursive call sits inside the definition span and stays excluded,
    # which is correct for the dead-code question — a function calling itself is
    # not evidence anyone else uses it.
    # ⚠ `unspanned_files` is the third bucket, and it is not optional. A symbol
    # carrying no usable `line` gives us nothing to exclude, so counting its
    # file would report the DEFINITION as a reference to itself — trading this
    # fix's false negative for a false positive on exactly the indexes with the
    # least metadata (older indexes, and any writer that omits `line`). Where
    # the evidence is missing we degrade to the pre-v1.108.226 behaviour and
