    ⚠⚠ The watcher used to answer "what is the new hash?" by loading the WHOLE

    of strings. **In the steady state that is nearly free and the first version
    of this docstring was WRONG to claim otherwise**: `incremental_save` keeps
    the LRU entry coherent, so the reload measures 0.001 s, not the 0.36 s a
    cold load costs. Measured, after asserting the opposite (#557).

    ⚠⚠ What it removes is a CLIFF, not a per-event cost, and the cliff is
    reachable by a setting we ship. `JCODEMUNCH_INDEX_CACHE_TTL` evicts an
    index that has sat unused -- and a watcher is idle between edits BY
    DEFINITION, so with the TTL set every edit pays a cold hydration. Measured
    at TTL=1 with a 1.5 s gap between edits: **0.001 s -> 0.19 s per event on
    15,075 symbols**, and #370 measured cold hydration of a 665k-symbol index
    at 7.5-11.4 MINUTES. The same happens whenever anything else moves the .db
    mtime between the save and the read (a second server instance, the
    embedding store, `refresh`). Reading what we already computed depends on
    none of that.

    ⚠ It cannot be answered by re-reading the file either, and that is why the
    full reload was there: between our read and the watcher's the file can
    change again, so the cache records a hash for content nobody indexed and
    the NEXT edit is skipped as unchanged (T6). Returning what we stored has
    neither problem -- there is no second read to race with.

    ⚠⚠ Emitted ONLY when `changed_paths` was supplied. `index_folder` is an MCP
    tool and this dict is unbounded in the size of the change set; a full walk
    would put every hash in the repository on the wire, against a response cap
    that refuses rather than truncates (JCODEMUNCH_RESPONSE_MAX_BYTES). The
    watcher is the only caller that passes `changed_paths`, so the tool's
    response is unchanged byte for byte.

    ⚠ ABSENT and EMPTY mean different things and the consumer must keep them
    apart: absent is "this run cannot tell you" (fall back to a full reload),
    empty is "nothing moved". Same UNKNOWN-is-not-False rule as `has_any()`.

    """Materialise a caller-supplied list of paths into the (files, warnings,
    skip_counts, requested_rels) shape that the standard indexing pipeline

    ``requested_rels`` is the list of root-relative entries the caller asked
    for — including directories and entries that no longer exist on disk. The
    incremental path uses it to scope deletions to exactly the listed subset so
    a subset refresh never prunes unlisted indexed files, while still removing a
    listed file that was deleted on disk (#333).

    Each entry can be absolute or relative to ``walk_root``. Files are added
    when they live under ``walk_root`` and have a known language. Directories
    are recursed via ``discover_local_files`` against that subtree (so the
    same .gitignore / framework filter applies). Entries outside the root,
    non-existent paths, symlink escapes, oversize files, secret/credential
    files, and binary files are rejected with per-entry warnings. The
    security-relevant filters (symlink, secret, binary, size) mirror the full
    walk; unlike the walk, explicit paths deliberately opt past gitignore and
    skip-directory rules so a caller can name a generated/ignored source file
    on purpose (e.g. ``index_dependency`` indexing a ``dist/`` snapshot).

    Used by ``index_folder(paths=...)`` so agents can re-index exactly the

    rg-matched list) without paying the cost of a full directory walk.

        extra_ignore_patterns: Additional gitignore-style patterns to exclude.
        follow_symlinks: Whether to include symlinked files. Symlinked directories

        context_providers: Whether to run context providers (default True).
            Set to False or set JCODEMUNCH_CONTEXT_PROVIDERS=0 to disable.
        incremental: When True and an existing index exists, only re-index changed files.
        changed_paths: Optional pre-known change set from the watcher, as a list of
            (change_type, absolute_path) tuples where change_type is one of
            "added", "modified", "deleted".  When provided with incremental=True
            and an existing index, skips full directory discovery (~3s → ~50ms).
        identity_mode: "config" (default), "local", or "git". Local mode keeps
            v1.90 path-hash identity; git mode opts in to git-root identity.
        force_reparse: Re-parse the files listed in `paths` even when their
            content is unchanged (v1.108.259, #395). Requires `paths` and
            `incremental`; ignored otherwise.

            ⚠ Without this, a subset refresh over unchanged files is a no-op by
            design: `detect_changes_with_mtimes` compares hashes and correctly
            reports "No changes detected". That is right for an edit and wrong
            for a PARSER_GENERATION upgrade, where the file content is identical
            and the stored SYMBOLS are the thing that is wrong. It is the whole
            reason `index_folder(paths=[...])` could not be used to slice up a
            generation upgrade before this existed.
        max_size: Per-file byte cap for this run, overriding config and the
            default (#429). ``get_max_file_size`` has accepted this override
            since v1.108.193, but no caller passed one and it reached no tool
            schema, so over MCP — the transport every actual user is on — the
            only route to the cap was editing a config file. Left None the
            resolution order is unchanged: project ``.jcodemunch.jsonc``, then
            global config / ``JCODEMUNCH_MAX_FILE_SIZE``, then the default.
